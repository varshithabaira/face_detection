Project Title:
Smart Attendance System Using Real-Time Face Recognition
Project Summary:
 I recently built an AI-powered real-time attendance system using facial recognition technology to automate check-ins and check-outs. Designed with a focus on efficiency, accuracy, and user experience, this hands-free system eliminates the need for manual input—ideal for workplaces, classrooms, or any environment requiring seamless time tracking.
Key Features:
Live Face Detection powered by MediaPipe FaceMesh
Facial Landmark Extraction and conversion into feature vectors
Identity Classification via a Random Forest model, fine-tuned with Optuna
Automated Time Logging: captures login, logout, session duration
Late Entry Detection and auto-logout after a period of inactivity
CSV-based Attendance Records for easy reporting and integration
System Architecture Includes:
User Registration with facial data capture
Model Training Pipeline with hyperparameter optimization
Real-Time Recognition Module with instant feedback
OOP-based Design for modularity and scalability
Smart Logging Engine with entry validation
Technologies Used:
 Python · OpenCV · MediaPipe · Scikit-learn · Optuna · Pandas · NumPy · Pickle
What I Learned:
 This project was an end-to-end exercise in integrating machine learning, real-time video processing, and software engineering. I gained hands-on experience in everything from data acquisition and model training to deploying responsive logic for live environments. It pushed me to apply both creative problem-solving and structured design principles.
